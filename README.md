# DevOpsAssistant
Five AI Bots working as a team to conceive a project concept, understand it thoroughly and then write the full stack code base with some human intervention for a prototype.

The bots have predefined roles and responsibilities, and they interact with each other with the DevOps Manager bot taking the lead role. The bots also have tasks and compliance checks that they need to adhere to.

The activities of each bot are logged in a text file for easy monitoring and debugging.

The project encourages continuous learning and cross-training within the bot models.
